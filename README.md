# U.F.O

Hello! I see that you are interested in my little game project. It's a simple point n' click Infinite "runner" genre kind of the game.
What do I mean by that? Well the aim of the game is to move your U.F.O(Ultrasound-based Free-floating Object) along the vast regions of space, avoiding obstacles along the way. The catch is that you have to move your U.F.O using high pitched pulses {They're pitch is lowered during gameplay ;)}. These pulses push the U.F.O along, and to also evade trouble. I hope you have fun with it!
